Introduction:
This is one of the approaches which can be used to solve a problem in optimal time. First, weâ€™ll understand every aspect of this approach and would later discuss a very common problem for a better understanding.

What is the two pointer approach?
As the name suggests, a two-pointer approach uses two-pointers to find the answer to a problem in the optimal time. When the given data is present in a linear form i.e. in terms of an array, vector, linked list, etc we can use this approach.

This approach is very useful when you want to reduce the space complexity to constant but the state of time complexity still remains arbitrary i.e. it would reduce to a large extent or to a small extent.

An extra data structure can solve some problems with better time complexity but space complexity is increased which is a problem that could be addressed using this approach.

Usage:
Two pointer approach can be used when you want to process two elements in a single iteration or determine a type of pattern. 

Example: Detecting loop in a linked list, checking palindrome in arrays, strings, and linked list, reversing a string or a linked list, two sum problem, finding the middle of a linked list, etc.
